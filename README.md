## ## Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

To make this portfolio your own, you'll need to customize a few things directly in the `index.html` file.

1.  **Personal Information:**
    * Search for "John Doe" and replace it with your name.
    * Update the bio, about section text, and social media links (`#`).
    * Replace the placeholder images with your own. The hero image and about image URLs can be found in the `#home` and `#about` sections.

2.  **Projects:**
    * In the `#projects` section, update the project titles, descriptions, technologies, live demo links, and code repository links for each project card.

3.  **Skills:**
    * In the `#skills` section, adjust the skill names and percentage values. The width of the progress bars is set via inline styles (e.g., `style="width: 95%"`).

4.  **Contact Form (EmailJS):**
    * Go to [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/) and create a free account.
    * Find your **User ID**, **Service ID**, and **Template ID**.
    * In the `<script>` section at the bottom of the `index.html` file, find and replace the placeholder values:

    ```javascript
    // Initialize EmailJS
    emailjs.init('YOUR_USER_ID'); // Replace with your EmailJS user ID

    // ...

    // Send the email
    emailjs.sendForm('YOUR_SERVICE_ID', 'YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID', this) // Replace with your IDs
    ```

5.  **CV/Resume:**
    * Find the "Download CV" button in the `#home` section and update the `href` attribute to point to your resume file.
